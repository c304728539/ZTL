This template library extend STL. It has rewrote some container, which has already existed, like Vector, List, Deque and so on. And also implement other data structure such as Graph, van Emde Boas Tree(vEBtree), Splay Tree(splay_tree), Size Balanced Tree(SBtree). Othersize, the library expose some data structureâ€™s interface that we can not access in STL. A well-known fact is Red Black Tree(RBtree) as the base of Map(map). Now, you have a direct access to them.
